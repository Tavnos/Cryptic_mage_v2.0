# Cryptic_mage_v2.0
RPG style game made with tkinter and random, taking most of the coded classes from v1.0

This is an alternative yet fun way of learning python. I have written, and refined this from my previous simple text based game. I have done every thing i could to keep it open, simple and on a Python3 level. 
I encourage you to test it ^^
